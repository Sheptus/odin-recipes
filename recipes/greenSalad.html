		<!-- Description -->
		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>Salad recipes are my favorite way to showcase vibrant, in-season produce – fruits and veggies that are so
			good on their own that you don’t need to do much to make them into a delicious meal. On cold winter nights,
			I like to brighten up our dinner table with a big, colorful mix of root veggies and hearty greens. On
			beautiful, warm days when I’d rather be outside than in the kitchen, summer salads are the perfect solution:
			they’re simple to toss together, but they’re totally delicious nonetheless.
		</p>

		<p>Whether you want to add more plant-based meals to your diet or are simply looking to change up your salad
			game, you’ll find tons of inspiration in the salad recipes below. With everything from green salads to pasta
			salads and beyond, these recipes are perfect for passing at potlucks, serving as dinner sides, and enjoying
			as full meals on their own.</p>
